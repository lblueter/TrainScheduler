# TrainScheduler

I built this project to keep track of a consistent schedule such as trains. 
I used dateFns to help me build the calculation behind the program.
Made using HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery.

How to use:
1. Enter in the train name, destination, time of arrival, and frequency

2. Click the submit button to add the information onto the table

3. Next arrival and minutes away are calculated for you!
